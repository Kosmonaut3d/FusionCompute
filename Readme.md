### Fusion Reimplementation

## Overview

This program implements a full Kinect Fusion algorithm, realized in OpenGL.

The computer shader code can be found in /resources/shaders.
The .cpp source code can be found in /src

## Compilation

This application has a dependency to OpenFramework -> https://openframeworks.cc/download/
For compilation OpenFrameworks has to be installed (runs on basically all platforms) and the OpenFrameworks Project Generator can then parse the folder and setup the locally used IDE for compilation.

## Binaries

For windows, in the \bin folder an sdfFusion.exe is precompiled.
